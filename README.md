**Movie-Recommendation-System**

The Movie Recommendation System is a data-driven project designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. By analyzing user behavior, movie features, and historical ratings, the system predicts and recommends movies that align with the user's taste. This project leverages techniques such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid models to deliver personalized recommendations. It provides an interactive user interface where users can explore top picks, search for titles, and discover new favorites, enhancing their overall movie-watching experience.
